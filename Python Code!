    # Per each letter trow a coin (random number included in [0, 1], 50%)
    
    #3. If the random number is less than 0.5 keep the word,
    # if it is higher that 0.5 mask the letter and add its position in the dictionary.

    # and the dictionary of masked letters.

# where 3 is the maximum number of attempts for guessing the word (score==0 the user lost)
